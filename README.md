# dotfiles
Files that make my terminal more comfortable

They're not fancy at all, but I was moving between machines, and decided to keep them here.

Being a `.zshrc`, these shortcuts, env vars, etc., are intended for ZSH.

## features:

### export EDITOR=nano

Stops `git` opening commit messages in `vi`.

### export PS1="%B%F{green}%2~%b%f %# "

This env var controls the prompt, which by default has a `user@hostname` at the start of every
command.

This gives you two levels of directory printout eg. `Projects/dotfiles`, `~/Projects` etc. 
In bold green, with a % at the end (or # if you're root)

### p

Mapped to `~/Projects`, for quickly `cd`ing.

### doom, doom2

Who wouldn't want an instant command to start DOOM?

I actually use this far more than you might expect.

### nvm

The lower part of the zshrc is auto generated by [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
